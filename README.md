Installation
============
 * You can locally clone this repository:
 ```
 git clone git@github.com:Duke-Ultrasound/fem.git
 ```

 This approach will work if you have an [SSH
 key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) uploaded to GitHub.
 If not, then you can also clone the reportory using:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/Duke-Ultrasound/fem.git
 ```

 * Add the fem subdirectories to your Matlab path.  One approach is to add the
   following to ```$HOME/matlab/startup.m```: 
 ```
 fem_root = 'PATH/TO/GIT/CLONED/fem';
 addpath(fullfile(fem_root, 'mesh'));
 addpath(fullfile(fem_root, 'field'));
 addpath(fullfile(fem_root, 'post'));
 ```
 where ```fem_root``` is the path of your git-cloned fem repository.

 * There is a ```probes``` submodule available to restricted institutions.  If
   you do not have access to that repository, then you can use
   ```field/linear.m``` and ```field/curvilinear.m``` as starting points to
   define transducers.  If you do have access, then you can initialize the
   submodule using ```git submodule init``` followed by ```git submodule
   update```.

 * All of the python scripts require python >=2.7 and are python3 compliant.
   All scripts have help available using the ```--help``` flag.


Code Layout
===========

This repository contains 3 subdirectories of code:

 1. ```mesh```: scripts to generate meshes, apply boundary conditions and
    simple loads ([mesh/README.md](mesh/README.md))
 2. ```field```: [Field II](http://field-ii.dk) scripts to simulate acoustic
    radiation force excitations to impose as point loads on your model.  The
    ```probes``` submodule can be utilized with these scripts
    ([field/README.md](field/README.md))
 3. ```post```: scripts to post-process LS-DYNA output for processing /
    visualization in ls-prepost, Matlab, and Paraview
    ([post/README.md](post/README.md))

Please see the ```README.md``` files in each respective subdirectory for more
detailed descriptions of the available scripts.

Coordinate & Unit Conventions
=============================

 * The mesh (LS-DYNA) and Field II spatial axis conventions are different (this
   is unfortunate, but maintained for legacy compatibility).

 * LS-DYNA and mesh-related tools use a rotated, right-hand rule coorindate
   system: 
   + Axial extends into -z, 
   + Lateral extends into +y, 
   + Elevation extends into -x.

 * LS-DYNA is run unitless, but scripts assume and scale quantitites assuming a
   CGS unit system.

 * Field II tools a standard, right-hand rule coordinate system:
   + Axial extends into +z, 
   + Lateral extends into +x, 
   + Elevation extends into +y.

 * Field II internally uses MKS units, but scripts will specify units on the
   inputs


Testing
=======
There are test scripts / models available for code validation and future
development ([test/README.md](test/README.md)).  Please use existing tests if
fixing bug / editing existing features, or create new tests for new features.
Ipython notebooks documenting testing, performance, etc. are also saved in some
of the testing directories.
